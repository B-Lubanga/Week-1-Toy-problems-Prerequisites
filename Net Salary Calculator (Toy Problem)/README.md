# Net Salary Calculator

# How It Works

# The calculator follows these steps:

# 1. Gross Salary Calculation:

# Gross Salary = Basic Salary + Benefits

# Deductions Applied:

# PAYE (Income Tax) → Calculated based on KRA tax brackets

# NHIF Deduction → Applied based on NHIF contribution rates

# NSSF Deduction → Typically 6% of Basic Salary (with a capped limit)

# Net Salary Calculation:

# Net Salary = Gross Salary - (PAYE + NHIF + NSSF)
