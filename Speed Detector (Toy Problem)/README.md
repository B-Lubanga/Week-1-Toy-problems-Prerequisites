# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

# Overview

# This program determines whether a driver is within the speed limit or should receive demerit points based on their speed.

# How It Works

# 1. The user inputs the speed of the car.

# 2. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the program outputs "Ok".

# 3. If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the program calculates demerit points:

# Every 5 km/h over 70 results in 1 demerit point.

# The total demerit points are displayed.

# 4. If a driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
